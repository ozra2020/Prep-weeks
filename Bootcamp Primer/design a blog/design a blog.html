        Write a program that has a shopper object. Include at least one property with each of the following data types as values to the properties:
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Function (called a "method" when it's inside an object like this. Check out an example for help writing your own)</li>
        In addition, you should add a groceryCart property to your object, which should be an Array of items that can commonly be found in a grocery cart.

      <ul>
        Programming is important:
       <li>For learning to innovate, create eco-friendly solutions for global problems.</li>
      <li>In our daily life to enhance and increase the power of computers and the internet.</li>
      <li>For speeding up the input and output processes in a machine.</li>
      <li>To automate, collect, manage, calculate, analyze the processing of data and information accurately.</li>
      <li>To create software and applications that help computer and mobile users in daily life.</li>
      <li>Due to all these reasons, it’s really important to learn how to use programming languages in our daily life.</li>
      <li>Java, javascript, C#, C++, PHP, Python, Swift, SQL, Ruby, etc.</li>
      <li>Programming languages are the reasons behind the innovations in information technologies.</li>
      <li>If today we are seeing robots, artificial intelligence, machine learning, bitcoins, blockchain, IoT (Internet of Things), Cloud Computing, etc.</li>
      <li>New technology and products in the IT industry, then it’s because of programming languages.</li>

          <li>A blog-style feed, where each blog post (which you'll just hard-code in for now) is in the center of the page, and as your scroll down the page it shows older blog posts.</li>
          <li>Each blog post should have a title of some kind</li>
          <li>Each blog post should have the date it was "published"</li>
          <li>Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text should wrap around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped text.</li>
          <li>The blog posts' content can just be hard-coded, meaning it'll all just be on a single page and you can just put filler text (lorem ipsum) there if you want.</li>

        Without using the bootstrap grid system, create a website that looks like this:
        You don't have to worry about making it responsive at this point.
        Here are the colors:
        <li>#F5C6D6</li>

        <li>#85CFD8</li>

      <ul>
        You are going to recreate the front page of a newspaper using block, inline and inline-block elements.
        Your newspaper should have:
        <li>A header with the name of your newspaper</li>
        <li> A title for the front page article</li>
        <li>A body with a story.</li>
        <li> Several words in the body should be individually styled using inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)</li>
        Come up with your own story. It can be anything, including satire or the recreation of an existing article somewhere. Make sure it looks nice so that someone could obviously tell it's suppose to be a newspaper.
        <b>Extra Credit:</b>
        Add a "Classifieds" section to your the newspaper. Title at top (block), classifieds cards with borders (inline-block), some of them could have images, whatever else you want to add.

      <ul>
        In this exercise you will use several css selectors to restyle elements of this page. The HTML base is already written for you and is found below for you to copy into your project.
        <b>Complete the following:</b>
        <li>Select the body and give it a background color of #111111.</li>
        <li>Select the h1 tag, change the font color to #E2E80F, center the text, and make it a bit larger than the default.</li>
        <li> Select the paragraphs, change the font-color to #eeeeee, make their font-size larger, and give them some larger separation between each line;</li>
        <li>Find a way to select all span tags inside the paragraph with the class of credits and make them look like anchor links (i.e. underline and colored blue, or another color that is easier to read on the dark background like #49DAFF).</li>
        <li>You could also optionally figure out how to make the cursor change to the little hand when the user is hovering over it to mimic even more closely a real link.</li>
        <li>Select the "film-description" ID, make the font a little smaller and change it to an italics style.</li>
